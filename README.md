# Color Guessing Game Project

This project is aimed at creating a color guessing game utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Development Process
- Created the basic HTML structure in `index.html`.
- Implemented the game functionality in JavaScript using the `script.js` file.
- Styled the game using CSS in `style.css`.

### Encountered Errors
- Error 1: Issue with colors not generating correctly. Resolved by debugging the `generateRandomColors` function in `script.js`.
- Error 2: Difficulty with the colors displaying in the incorrect format. Solved by modifying the `randomColor` function to generate RGB values.

### Project Functionalities
- Implemented an easy and hard mode for the game, allowing players to choose their preferred level of difficulty.
- Added a reset button that generates new colors for the game.
